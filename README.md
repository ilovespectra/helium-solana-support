## Solana Builders!

The Solana Ecosystem just turned 3! She's young, and moving fast. Learning developing on Solana can be tricky for this reason. You may find that walkthroughs from 4-6 months ago are nearly obsolete as modules get renamed, sunsetted, or replaced. Chances are, copy pasting your terminal errors into google won't yield any results. A wise builder once said "if there's copy-code base available for what you're building, you're already late. If there's not, you're onto something before the rest of the world and it's on you to create the docs you seek!"

Buildspace was the most help for me, but they just announced 'buildspace is dead' and are opening a school. Give it a shot though and see what you can complete, the struggle is valuable to the learning. I'll do my best to try to highlight tutorials and courses here that took the fewest years off my life.
