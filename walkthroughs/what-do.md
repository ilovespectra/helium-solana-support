# As a Helium Hotspot owner / HNT holder / etc. 
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO before/after the migration?
# Nothing
Your hotspots will be automatically transferred to your new Solana address<br>
Your HNT will be automatically transferred to your new Solana address<br>
Your hotspot NFTs will appear in your wallet automatically<br>

HNT held in exchange accounts should be snapshot and migrated to new Solana addresses, which is how it should also work in your Helium Wallet App for example.

# What if I have a Ledger?
Depends on what's on it. If you've got SHT, veHNT, hotspots, Mobile, or otherwise, the word from Helium devs is to temporarily move those to the Helium Wallet App. If you've just got HNT in there, you can simply wait til after the migration. The team said they would release a 'click-next'-style migration wizzard to help.

# Is HNT dead?
HNT is the Helium Native Token. The Helium Network currently runs a L1, or Layer 1, blockchain.<br>
HNT will become an SPL token on the Solana blockchain, meaning ALL HNT anywhere you see it listed today
will be 'de-listed' and will have to be 're-listed' as HNT on Solana. The name will not change, but the token contract is on a totally different blockchain.<br><br>
ALL HNT will become an SPL token. Neither the Helium Network, nor the Native Token, are going away after the migration.<br><br> Those of us building on Solana believe the contrary.

# Why Binance delist?
Read that last section again.<br><br>
<b>ALL HNT anywhere you see it listed today
will be 'de-listed' and have to be 're-listed' as HNT on Solana</b>

# When Binance relist?
