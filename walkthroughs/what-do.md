# As a Helium Hotspot owner / HNT holder / etc. 
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO before/after the migration?
# Nothing
Your hotspots will be automatically transferred to your new Solana address<br>
Your HNT will be automatically transferred to your new Solana address<br>
Your hotspot NFTs will appear in your wallet automatically<br>

HNT held in exchange accounts will be snapshot and migrated to new Solana addresses 

# Is HNT dead?
HNT is the Helium Native Token. The Helium Network currently runs a L1, or Layer 1, blockchain.<br>
HNT will become an SPL token on the Solana blockchain, meaning ALL HNT anywhere you see it listed today
will be 'de-listed' and will have to be 're-listed' as HNT on Solana. The name will not change, but the token contract is on a totally different blockchain.<br><br>
ALL HNT will become an SPL token. Neither the Helium Network, nor the Native Token, are going away after the migration.<br><br> Those of us building on Solana believe the contrary.

# Why Binance delist?
Read that last section again.<br><br>
<b>ALL HNT anywhere you see it listed today
will be 'de-listed' and have to be 're-listed' as HNT on Solana</b>

# When Binance relist?
Ask Binance
