# Helium-Enabled Devices / Solana DApps

Helium will thrive on the Solana blockchain because of its high performance and scalability. Solana's PoH consensus mechanism allows for fast transaction processing and block confirmation times, which improves the Helium network's efficiency. Additionally, Solana's account state tree structure provides a more efficient way of storing and accessing Helium network data compared to other blockchain technologies.

Furthermore, Solana's support for smart contracts could enable the development of decentralized applications (DApps) that leverage the Helium network's capabilities. Developers will build DApps on Solana that utilize the Helium network's data, such as location-based services or asset tracking, further expanding the potential use cases for the Helium network.
